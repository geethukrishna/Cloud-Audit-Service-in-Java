# Cloud-Audit-Service-in-Java
This project's purpose is to provide data integrity to the user from the third party audit service provides
This project will not allow the auditor to view the entire file at one time 
he will view all the block at a time
so he wont be having access to all the blocks 
So basically what it do's is it will always secure the usersa data
And if the data is tampered or modified we can recover the original data
you can view the demo of working of my project in the youtube
